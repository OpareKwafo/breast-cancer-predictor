## Project Description

Breast Cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide representing the majority of new cancer cases,
and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a significant public health problem in today's society.
The early diagnosis of Breast cancer can improve the prognosis and chance of survival significantly, as it can promote
timely clinical treatment to patients. Further accurate classification of benign tumors can prevent patients undergoing  
treatments.

The content of this repository showcase a data science project that covers the entire data science process, starting from
collecting data to deploying the solution. This project uses a machine learning to predict whether a patient is at risk of
having cancer or not. The app is deployed using Flask which you can run locally for predictions. Data is obtained from the
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29).

**Benign:** Not likely to get cancer  
**Malignant:** Likely to get cancer
